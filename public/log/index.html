                    <p>I had recently spawned a new world in single-player Minecraft. Everything was normal at first as
                        I began chopping down trees and crafting a workbench. I noticed something move amongst the dense
                        fog (I have a very slow computer so I have to play with render distance tiny). I thought it was
                        a cow, so I pursued it, hoping to grab some hides for . It wasn't a cow though. Looking back at
                        me was another character with the default skin, but his eyes were empty. I saw no name pop up,
                        and I double-checked to make sure I wasn't in multiplayer mode. He didn't stay long, he looked
                        at me and quickly ran into the fog. I perused out of curiosity, but he was gone. I continued on
                        with the game, not sure what to think. As I expanded to world I saw things that seemed out of
                        place for the random map generator to make; 2x2 tunnels in the rocks, smooth ocean, and groves
                        of trees with all their leaves cut off. I would constantly think I saw the other "player" in the
                        deep fog, but I never got a better look at him. I tried increasing my render distance to far
                        whenever I thought I saw him, but to no avail. I saved the map and went on the forums to see if
                        anyone else had found the pseudo-player. There were none. I created my own topic telling of the
                        man and asking if anyone had a similar experience. The post was deleted within five minutes. I
                        tried again, and the topic was deleted even faster. I received a PM from username 'Herobrine'
                        containing one word: 'Stop.' When I went to look at Herobrine's profile, the page 404'd. I
                        received an email from another forum user. He claimed the mods can read the forum user messages,
                        so we were safer using that he had seen the mystery player too, and had a small 'directory' of
                        other users who had seen him as well. Their worlds were littered with obviously man-made
                        features as well, and described their mystery player to have no pupils. About a month passed
                        until I heard from my informant again. Some of the people who had encountered the mystery man
                        had looked into the name Herobrine and found that name to be frequently used by a swedish gamer.
                        After some further information gathering, it was revealed to be the brother of Notch, the game's
                        developer. I personally emailed Notch, and asked him if he had a brother. It took him a while,
                        but he emailed me back a very short message. I did, but he is no longer with us. -Notch haven't
                        seen the mystery man since our first encounter, and I haven't noticed any changes to the world
                        other than my own. I was able to press 'print screen' when I first saw him. Here's the only
                        evidence I have of his existence.</p>
